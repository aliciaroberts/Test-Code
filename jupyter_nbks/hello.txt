Omg im like so glad that this worked

I hope i can add this to my repo without it breaking 

this is hard stuff 

here's what i know: 

you pull to see whats changed 
you status to see if you are caught up and need to add or commit anything

you commit, and then you push -- thats key

you do add to make it able to be committed
